# KNN
Knn or k nearest neighbors is a simple classification algorithm. It does not require training.
It works by assuming that similar objects are close together. By looking at the k nearest neighbors, we can classify the object.
The algorithm works as follows:
1. Find the k nearest neighbors of the chosen data point.
2. Assign the class of the chosen data point to the most common class among the k nearest neighbors.
