# ML algorithms from scratch
Everybody can just import sklearn and start using algorithms but that makes you an engineer not a researcher. 
In order to be able to contribute to the world of machine learning, you need to understand how algorithms work, 
not just use them.

## Content
In this repo you will find implementations of popular ML algorithms from scratch using just python and numpy. 
The algorithms are implemented in a way that is easy to understand and follow and the algorithms are explained in detail in the markdown files. 
The algorithms are organized into two categories: supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

### The currently implemented algorithms in Python are:
- Linear Regression
- K-means
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- CART
- Random Forest Regression
- Gradient Boosting Regression

### The currently implemented algorithms in C are:
- Linear Regression
- KNN
- K-Means

## Future plans
- [X] Random Forest
- [X] Gradient Boosting
- [ ] RNNs
- [ ] CNNs
- [ ] NNs
- [ ] CUDA optimizations
- [ ] Transformers
- [ ] rewrite in C

### AI usage
AI was used mainly for visualizing the results of the algorithms and research. 
The logic was implemented without the use of AI. The point of this repo is to learn how 
algorithms work, not to develop the perfect Machine learning library.
